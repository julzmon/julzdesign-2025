  <p class="max-w-prose text-2xl leading-1.7">Westrock was undergoing a digital transformation, but the experience layer was fragmented across teams and tools. There was no cohesive design system in place, and accessibility was inconsistent. Most teams used their own design patterns, and many still relied on Sketch. The lack of standardization slowed down development, caused rework, and created inconsistent experiences across products like the Internet of Packaging (IoP) and various internal tools.</p>

    <p class="max-w-prose mb-8">I was the sole architect and driver of the Westrock Design System. I wore multiple hats across the lifespan of the project. Serving as the design system architect, product manager, scrum master, accessibility lead, designer, and front-end contributor.</p>
    <p class="max-w-prose mb-8">I defined the vision, created the roadmap, and established the system’s governance model, token strategy, documentation, and rollout process. I also guided the transition from Sketch to Figma and designed the cross-platform component library from the ground up.</p>
    <p class="max-w-prose">As adoption grew, I collaborated with developers, product owners, and stakeholders to validate patterns and integrate the system into products like IoP and the Admin Portal. I also held weekly office hours to support teams and conducted audits of the existing design layer to identify inconsistencies and technical debt.</p>
