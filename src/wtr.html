  <p class="mr-6 mb-5 max-w-prose text-2xl">Westrock was undergoing a digital transformation, but the experience layer was fragmented across teams and tools. There was no cohesive design system in place, and accessibility was inconsistent. Most teams used their own design patterns, and many still relied on Sketch. The lack of standardization slowed down development, caused rework, and created inconsistent experiences across products like the Internet of Packaging (IoP) and various internal tools.</p>

    <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl mb-2">Evangelizing the Design System</h2>
    <p class="mb-5 max-w-prose text-xl">Recognizing the importance of stakeholder buy-in, I created a compelling presentation deck and began evangelizing the benefits and potential impact of the design system. Ongoing engagement and feedback sessions allowed us to refine the system's foundation based on real-world insights.</p>
    <p class="mb-5 max-w-prose text-xl">Throughout the project, I actively engaged with stakeholders, including lead engineering, to evangelize our technology strategy and CSS architecture. This collaborative approach resulted in building trust and buy-in from engineering.</p>
    <p class="mb-5 max-w-prose text-xl">In addition, I created a promotional video to showcase the design system's capabilities and benefits. This video was a valuable tool for communicating the system's value to stakeholders and attracting new users.</p>

      <p class="ml-12 mr-6 mb-5 max-w-prose text-xl">I created an extensive backlog encompassing tasks for building a documentation site, infrastructure setup, starter projects, and tokenization. This backlog was strategically designed to support the development of the design system. I then presented the backlog to developers on my team, showcasing the vision and providing them with a clear roadmap.</p>

      <p class="ml-12 mr-6 mb-5 max-w-prose text-xl">One significant milestone was successfully transitioning from Sketch to Figma. I worked closely with procurement and legal departments to obtain necessary approvals and showcased the benefits of Figma through a comprehensive comparison chart. This transition empowered our teams with enhanced collaboration and productivity.

    <p class="ml-12 mb-5">Close collaboration with product teams ensured the successful implementation of the design system. I worked with product teams to implement the design system in a new high-profile project, ensuring a consistent and delightful user experience. Additionally, I collaborated with the core services team to implement the design system into WestRock's sign-in experience, redesigning the profile and sign-in flows using design system components and patterns.</p>
    <p class="ml-12 mb-5">Working closely with the brand team to operationalize new branding guidelines into our design system. Through the power of tokenization and our design system, we were able to efficiently incorporate an updated and expanded color palette and new themes, completing and publishing it within days.</p>
